**Train custom IS-Net models for precise sprite sheet background removal** and integrate them with [rembg](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg) for production use.

Built on top of the [DIS (Dichotomous Image Segmentation)](https://github.com/xuebinqin/DIS) architecture, this project provides a complete Windows-based workflow for training, converting, and deploying custom background removal models optimized for game sprites, pixel art, and character sheets.
